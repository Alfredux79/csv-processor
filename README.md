# Spring Integration Practice Project: csv-processor

This is a SpringBoot project to do a very simple practice of the [enterprise integration patterns](http://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/) using the spring framework.

## System Description:

The system does the following:

- Reads csv files from a folder using an inbound [channel adapter](http://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/patterns/messaging/ChannelAdapter.html) and places the file to a [channel](http://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/patterns/messaging/MessageChannel.html) called *"csvFilesChannel"*
- A [transformer](http://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/patterns/messaging/MessageTranslator.html) reads the file from the channel and transorms it to a byte array and sends it  to another channel called *"routingChannel"*.
- The *"routingChannel"* sends the files to a [recipipent-list-router](http://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/patterns/messaging/RecipientList.html) that duplicates the message to two different channels, one for processing called *"csvProcessingChannel"* and one for saving a backup of the processed file called *"saveProcessedFileChannel"*.

  - *"routingChannel"* flow:

    - A [service activator](http://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/patterns/messaging/MessagingAdapter.html) calls a service to process the file from the processing channel and store it's contents in a relation database.

  - *"saveProcessedFileChannel"* flow:

    - An outbound [channel adapter](http://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/patterns/messaging/ChannelAdapter.html) ends the circuit on the backup side saving the file to the processed folder.
